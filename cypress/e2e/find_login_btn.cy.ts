// This is a code snippet written in Cypress, which is an end-to-end testing framework for web applications.

// The line /// <reference types="cypress"/> is a TypeScript reference comment that allows Cypress types to be used in this file without importing them.

// The context function sets a logical context for the test that follows it, in this case "Admin Login".

// beforeEach function runs before each test in the block. In this case, it navigates the browser to the login page by visiting the URL "http://localhost:3000/login".

// it function defines a test case. The string passed as an argument is a description of the test case. The function passed as the second argument, an arrow function, is the test case. In this case, it checks if the login button exists on the page by searching for an HTML element with the tag "button" and the text content "login".

// export {} is an empty export statement. It makes the file a module, which means that variables defined in this file will not be accessible from other files unless they are explicitly imported.

// In summary, this code snippet is a test case that checks if the login button exists on the login page of a web application. It uses Cypress framework to visit the login page, search for the login button, and assert if it exists.
